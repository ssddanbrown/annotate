## Plan

Two canvases:

- Drawing canvas (Where we draw to)
- Screenshot canvas (Pasted by user)

## Ideas

- Game-style rendering, Each object has a render function.
- Detection for when to draw so can be skipped?
- Loop through "drawing" objects to render.
- On export, flatted and return.

## Tools

- Square box
- Circle box
- Custom drawing?
- Step numbers

## Features

- Paste to load
- Export to clipboard
- Export to file
- Export to data URI
